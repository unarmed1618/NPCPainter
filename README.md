NPCPainter
==========

A Paint Program designed to follow specific requirements of the BlackWhite game project by James Covenant. Exports to png file that is usable with Stencyl

=========

This program uses Swing and AWT to manage painting functions, and hijacks simple paint principles and does some neato stuff.
My code is not amazing, but I feel accomplished at having done it.

=========

In order to download the actual program and not the code, download "NPCPainterDistribute.zip" for windows, and "NPCPainter.jar" for mac.
